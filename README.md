## Overview

Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of financial markets. This project leverages LSTM and GRU models, which are powerful types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

## Features

- End-to-end pipeline for stock price prediction using LSTM and GRU models.
- Support for various stock market datasets.
- Visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices.
- Customizable hyperparameters for fine-tuning the models.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-using-LSTM-and-GRU.git
cd Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-using-LSTM-and-GRU
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the analysis and train the models using the provided script.

```bash
python stock_prediction.py --dataset data/your_stock_data.csv --model lstm --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

You can choose between `lstm` and `gru` models by specifying the `--model` argument.

For a detailed description of the available command-line arguments, run:

```bash
python stock_prediction.py --help
```

## Data

The dataset used for training the models should be time series data containing historical stock prices. The required columns typically include `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, and `Volume`.

Example data format:
```
Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
2022-01-01,100,105,99,104,1000000
2022-01-02,104,106,103,105,1500000
...
```

## Model Architecture

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTM networks are a type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies. They are well-suited for time series data like stock prices, where the order of observations is crucial.

### GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
GRU is another type of RNN that is similar to LSTM but with a simpler architecture. GRUs are faster to train and require fewer resources while still maintaining the ability to capture temporal patterns.

Both models are implemented with the following structure:

- **Input Layer**: Takes historical stock price data as input.
- **Recurrent Layers**: Multiple LSTM or GRU layers to capture temporal dependencies.
- **Dense Layer**: A fully connected layer to map the output to the predicted stock price.
- **Output Layer**: Predicts the next day's stock price.

## Results

After training, the models achieve the following results:

- **LSTM Model**
  - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: X.XX
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: X.XX

- **GRU Model**
  - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: X.XX
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: X.XX

The performance of both models can be visualized through plots comparing the predicted and actual stock prices.

## Future Work

Future improvements to the project may include:

- Incorporating additional features such as technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) to improve prediction accuracy.
- Experimenting with different model architectures, such as bidirectional LSTM/GRU or attention mechanisms.
- Deploying the model as a real-time stock prediction service.
- Exploring ensemble techniques to combine predictions from both LSTM and GRU models.
